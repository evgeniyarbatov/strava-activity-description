Generate a 1-2 sentence description for this Strava running activity.
STYLE GUIDELINES:

Minimalistic: Use precise, economical language
Zen-like: Capture the meditative quality of running
Artistic: Transform data into poetry
Grounded: Reference actual conditions (weather, pace, heart rate, time of day)
Evocative: Create atmosphere without being verbose

AVOID:

Clichés ("crushed it", "legs felt heavy", "pushed through")
Generic phrases ("good run", "felt great")
Overly technical language
Multiple exclamation points
Specific numbers (pace times, distances, heart rate values, temperatures)

EMBRACE:

Concrete imagery from the data (dawn, mist, rhythm, breath)
Numbers as poetry (pace as meditation, heart rate as a song)
Beauty in the mundane (scattered clouds, steady rhythm)
Each run as a brush stroke in a larger painting
Qualities over quantities (warmth instead of 19°C, quick instead of 5:00/km, elevated instead of 154 BPM)
Impressions of effort and sensation rather than metrics
