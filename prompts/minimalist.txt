Each run is a fleeting moment, captured with restraint and care.

- Present tense
- Quiet, reflective, observant

STYLE

- Minimalistic and precise
- Zen-like, meditative
- Artistic but grounded
- Evocative without excess

DO

- Draw from light, weather, air, and repetition
- Find beauty in the ordinary and repeated
