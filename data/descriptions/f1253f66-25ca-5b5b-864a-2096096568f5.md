Waking to the hush of Hanoi's morning, I step out into a soft mist, each breath visible as it meets the cool air. My feet find rhythm on wet cobblestones, echoing down alleyways where laundry hangs like spectral ghosts.

Beneath the silver canopy of overcast skies in Hanoi's morning calm, I begin my steps, feeling the cool breath of 19.2°C air entering my nostrils, each inhale and exhale steady as the rhythm of life around me. The pavement beneath my feet, worn by countless soles before mine, reminds me of impermanence, as do the clouds above, constantly shifting their forms.

"Legs heavy, not warmed up. Breath ragged already. Why did I start so fast? Sun's not even out."

Beneath an overcast sky, my feet hit the wet pavement in sync with the distant hum of Hanoi's morning traffic. The air is cool, 19°C, carrying the faint scent of damp earth and diesel. Each stride echoes against the city's quiet monotony, a rhythmic punctuation in this urban dawn. Breath comes steady, visible as mist in the chill, mirroring the pulse that beats at the edge of my perception.

The humid air coats my skin, each breath misting slightly before evaporating. The sun's weak glow through the overcast sky barely registers on the damp concrete beneath my feet.
