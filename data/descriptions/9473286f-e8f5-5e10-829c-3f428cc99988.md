In the hush before dawn, my breath puffs like whispers, visible in Hà Nội's crisp air. The city awakens gently, its traffic weaving around me like water around a stone.

The Hà Nội dawn breaks with a perky coldness, my breath steady against the scarf as bright light spills over the waking city. Past forest edges and the still pond, traffic weaves a fluid dance, carrying me through a serenely easy morning.

As the sun begins to paint the sky over Hanoi, I start my run, feeling the cool air embrace me. Each step is a gentle exploration, observing the sensations in my body, the impermanence of clouds overhead, and the fluidity of life in the harmonious traffic around me.

As the Hà Nội sunrise warms the crisp air, I notice each gentle stride and the calm flow of traffic, observing how every sensation and sound simply arises and passes.

The first step crunches the frost-kissed grass. A scarf's soft weight around my neck, its ends dancing with each breath. Sunrise glints off dew drops clinging to leaves like tiny, perfect worlds. The pond reflects the emerging day, unbroken except for a lone bird's ripple.

I recall the air, sharp and cool enough for the scarf. Scooters drift past, a continuous whisper in the early light.
