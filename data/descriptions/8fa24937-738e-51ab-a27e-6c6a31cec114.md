Beneath the gentle patter of rain on my umbrella, I tread the familiar Hanoi streets at dawn, each step whispering the impermanence of my body's efforts. The cool air enters my nostrils, expands in my lungs, and exits as a cloud of warmth into the chill, each breath a mindfulness bell marking time's ceaseless march.

Through the cool Hà Nội rain, I simply observe each swift stride, the body's rising exertion, and the rhythmic rush of breath, knowing all these sensations will pass.

The cold bites, but it's the rain that stings my eyes. Each breath is fire in my lungs. Hanoi wakes, distant and muted through the haze.

Months later, I think of that January morning in Hà Nội. The city was still dark. What stays is the cold. Not much rain, just a dampness, but I felt it like a fine spray on my forearms. That sharpness was a thin membrane over the deep burn in my chest, a constant pressure pushing through the quiet.
