Under the veil of dawn's first light, I navigate Hà Nội's quiet streets, each breath syncopated with the city's gentle awakening. The wind plays tag with my ponytail, its unpredictable gusts a dance partner more eager than I.

The Hà Nội aurora is a soft grey canvas today, the overcast sky mirroring the still park lake. Blustery gusts meet my light legs and steady breath, a serene, ordinary rhythm through the quiet dawn.

Breathing in the cool, damp air as I begin my run at dawn, I feel the soft earth beneath my feet, each step an acknowledgment of impermanence.

Under the aurora light in Hà Nội, I feel the blustery gusts against my skin and the steady rhythm of breath carrying this body along the path. Each passing sensation and thought, like the overcast clouds above, arises and dissolves, a gentle flow.

The wind nips at my cheeks, a relentless tag-of-war. Clouds above, heavy and unmoving, mirror the monotony beneath. A solitary leaf spirals downwards, an isolated dancer in the grey ballet of Hanoi's dawn.

What I keep is the wind. A constant press against my skin, shifting, guiding me through the turn. The light was just a soft, unbroken grey.
