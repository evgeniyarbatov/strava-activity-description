As I step onto the quiet Hanoi street at dawn's first light, I feel the cool morning air kiss my skin, and with each breath in, I inhale the calm tranquility of the waking city. My feet touch down softly on the pavement, one after another, each step a gentle dance with impermanence, as the world around me begins its day, fluidly flowing like the peaceful pond I'll soon pass by.

Waking up to the morning's birth in Hà Nội. The city still held its breath, the air pleasingly crisp on my skin, like the first sip of green tea. A clear sky stretched out above, unblemished by clouds or smog, as if the day was eager to present itself without disguise.
